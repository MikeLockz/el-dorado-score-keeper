# Architecture Review: Problems & Solutions

## Overview

This document analyzes the current El Dorado Score Keeper architecture at a detailed level, identifying potential problems and providing recommended solutions with complexity and risk assessments.

---

## 1. Event Sourcing Overhead

### **Problem 1.1: Complex State Reconstruction**

**Issue**: Replaying events from snapshots adds complexity and potential performance bottlenecks during startup/rehydration.

**Current State**: The system replays events from the last snapshot to reconstruct current state, which can be slow for long event histories.

**Recommended Solution**: **Hybrid State Strategy**

- **Approach**: Use event sourcing for critical game actions but maintain denormalized state for UI data
- **Implementation**:
  - Keep event sourcing for score changes, game state transitions
  - Store computed state (current scores, player order) directly in snapshots
  - Only replay events when snapshots are corrupted or missing
- **Rationale**: Reduces startup time while maintaining audit trail for critical actions
- **Complexity**: Medium - requires careful separation of critical vs non-critical state
- **Risk**: Low - preserves existing event model for game data

### **Problem 1.2: Event Storage Bloat**

**Issue**: Storing every event indefinitely leads to growing storage requirements and slower performance.

**Current State**: No mechanism for archiving or purging old events.

**Recommended Solution**: **Event Retention Policy with Archiving**

- **Approach**: Implement tiered event retention based on age and importance
- **Implementation**:
  - Keep last 1000 events in primary storage
  - Archive older events to compressed storage
  - Maintain only final state for completed games older than 30 days
  - Provide "export game history" feature for users
- **Rationale**: Balances storage efficiency with user needs for game history
- **Complexity**: Medium - requires archive storage and cleanup jobs
- **Risk**: Low - archiving is reversible and user-controllable

### **Problem 1.3: Debugging Complexity**

**Issue**: Tracing issues through event chains is difficult for developers.

**Current State**: No developer tools for visualizing event flow or state evolution.

**Recommended Solution**: **Event Timeline Debugger**

- **Approach**: Build a developer dashboard for event inspection
- **Implementation**:
  - Visual timeline of events with filtering
  - State diff viewer for each event
  - "Time travel" slider to see state at any point
  - Event replay with breakpoints
- **Rationale**: Makes event sourcing a benefit rather than a burden for debugging
- **Complexity**: High - requires significant UI development
- **Risk**: Low - developer-only tool, no impact on production

## 2. Dual Storage Complexity

### **Problem 2.1: Synchronization Issues**

**Issue**: Managing both IndexedDB and LocalStorage increases complexity and potential for data inconsistency.

**Current State**: Dual adapters with fallback logic, but no conflict resolution mechanism.

**Recommended Solution**: **Progressive Storage Enhancement**

- **Approach**: Use IndexedDB as primary, LocalStorage only for critical settings
- **Implementation**:
  - IndexedDB for events, snapshots, game data
  - LocalStorage only for user preferences and last active game ID
  - Remove automatic fallback, provide manual "export/import" for data migration
- **Rationale**: Simplifies storage stack while maintaining data portability
- **Complexity**: Low - removes complexity rather than adding it
- **Risk**: Medium - reduces automatic recovery options

### **Problem 2.2: Storage Quota Management**

**Issue**: Complex quota monitoring suggests storage limits are a real constraint.

**Current State**: Basic quota detection but limited user-facing solutions.

**Recommended Solution**: **Smart Storage Management**

- **Approach**: Proactive storage optimization with user control
- **Implementation**:
  - Automatic cleanup of old completed games
  - Compression of event history
  - Storage usage dashboard for users
  - "Storage settings" page with cleanup options
- **Rationale**: Gives users control while preventing quota exceeded errors
- **Complexity**: Medium - requires UI and cleanup logic
- **Risk**: Low - users can always export data before cleanup

### **Problem 2.3: Cleanup Complexity**

**Issue**: Snapshot compaction logic adds moving parts that could fail.

**Current State**: Complex snapshot compaction with periodic cleanup jobs.

**Recommended Solution**: **Simplified Snapshot Strategy**

- **Approach**: Use geometric snapshot intervals instead of complex compaction
- **Implementation**:
  - Keep snapshots at intervals: 1, 5, 25, 125, 625 events
  - Delete intermediate snapshots automatically
  - Always keep last 10 snapshots regardless of interval
- **Rationale**: Predictable, simple algorithm with guaranteed recovery points
- **Complexity**: Low - much simpler than current compaction logic
- **Risk**: Low - more snapshots than minimal, but still bounded

## 3. Performance Concerns

### **Problem 3.1: State Management Bottlenecks**

**Issue**: Single-threaded event processing could become bottleneck with complex state updates.

**Current State**: All state changes through single event pipeline with synchronous reducers.

**Recommended Solution**: **Selective Async Processing**

- **Approach**: Make expensive state updates asynchronous
- **Implementation**:
  - Keep critical updates (scores, game state) synchronous
  - Move expensive calculations (statistics, insights) to Web Workers
  - Update UI with optimistic updates, reconcile with actual results
- **Rationale**: Maintains responsiveness for critical actions while allowing complex computations
- **Complexity**: High - requires Web Workers and optimistic UI updates
- **Risk**: High - complex synchronization between main thread and workers

### **Problem 3.2: Selector Memoization Limits**

**Issue**: Simple memoization insufficient for complex derived state calculations.

**Current State**: Basic memoization based on object identity only.

**Recommended Solution**: **Advanced Selector Library**

- **Approach**: Replace custom memoization with Reselect or similar library
- **Implementation**:
  - Composable selectors with dependency tracking
  - Selective invalidation based on state changes
  - Performance metrics for expensive selectors
  - Selector debugging tools
- **Rationale**: Proven solution with better performance and developer experience
- **Complexity**: Medium - library integration and selector refactoring
- **Risk**: Low - well-established patterns and libraries

### **Problem 3.3: Cross-tab Sync Overhead**

**Issue**: Broadcasting every state change could impact performance with many tabs.

**Current State**: Every event broadcast to all tabs via BroadcastChannel.

**Recommended Solution**: **Batched Cross-tab Updates**

- **Approach**: Batch and throttle cross-tab communications
- **Implementation**:
  - Collect events for 100ms before broadcasting
  - Only broadcast critical events immediately (game-ending actions)
  - Deduplicate events from multiple tabs
  - Use "heartbeat" mechanism instead of full sync
- **Rationale**: Reduces communication overhead while maintaining consistency
- **Complexity**: Medium - requires batching logic and deduplication
- **Risk**: Medium - potential for temporary inconsistencies between tabs

## 4. Data Integrity & Consistency

### **Problem 4.1: Event Validation Gaps**

**Issue**: Heavy runtime validation suggests potential type safety issues.

**Current State**: Runtime validation with Zod schemas for all events.

**Recommended Solution**: **Type-safe Event Creation**

- **Approach**: Make invalid events impossible at compile time
- **Implementation**:
  - Use TypeScript discriminated unions more effectively
  - Create type-safe event constructors that guarantee valid payloads
  - Remove runtime validation for development builds
  - Keep runtime validation for production error reporting
- **Rationale**: Catch errors at compile time, reduce runtime overhead
- **Complexity**: High - requires significant TypeScript refactoring
- **Risk**: Medium - potential for runtime errors if TypeScript types are incorrect

### **Problem 4.2: Event Ordering Issues**

**Issue**: Timestamps don't guarantee causal ordering across tabs.

**Current State**: Events have timestamps but no explicit ordering guarantees.

**Recommended Solution**: **Logical Clock Ordering**

- **Approach**: Implement Lamport timestamps or vector clocks
- **Implementation**:
  - Add logical sequence number to each event
  - Use vector clocks for multi-tab scenarios
  - Implement conflict resolution for out-of-order events
  - Maintain causal relationships between events
- **Rationale**: Provides strong consistency guarantees across distributed scenarios
- **Complexity**: High - requires understanding of distributed systems concepts
- **Risk**: High - complex algorithms, potential for subtle bugs

### **Problem 4.3: Partial Failures**

**Issue**: Append process has multiple phases that could fail midway.

**Current State**: Event append → state update → persistence in separate transactions.

**Recommended Solution**: **Atomic State Updates**

- **Approach**: Use database transactions to guarantee atomicity
- **Implementation**:
  - Single IndexedDB transaction for event append and state update
  - Rollback entire operation if any step fails
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
  - User notification for persistent failures
- **Rationale**: Eliminates partial state updates and improves reliability
- **Complexity**: Medium - requires transaction management and retry logic
- **Risk**: Low - standard database patterns with proven solutions
