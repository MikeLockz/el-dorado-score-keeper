# Phase 2 Accessibility Review

## Scope

- Updated responsive site header navigation for desktop and mobile breakpoints.
- Games archive table actions, confirmation flows, and loading states.
- Color token refresh for score grid badges and supporting surfaces.

## Checks Performed

- Manual keyboard traversal of header, games archive list, single-player score grid controls, and modal confirmations.
- Programmatic inspection with the axe DevTools browser extension covering `/`, `/games`, and `/single-player` (no violations after fixes).
- Screen reader spot-check (VoiceOver) of the games archive flow to verify announced labels and dialog focus management.

## Key Fixes

- Replaced `window.confirm` prompts with Radix `AlertDialog`, ensuring focus trapping, labelled actions, and escape handling.
- Added live region messaging for archive mutations so screen reader users receive async status updates.
- Introduced shared skeleton components to prevent layout shifts while data loads.
- Refined state badge color tokens to maintain contrast in both themes and align with new semantic naming.
- Implemented desktop navigation with inline links and `aria-current` signalling while retaining the dropdown on small screens.

## Outstanding Follow-ups

- Integrate automated axe checks into CI (tracked in Phase 3 tooling work).
- Evaluate skip-link target coverage once new onboarding and analytics screens land (Phase 4 dependency).
