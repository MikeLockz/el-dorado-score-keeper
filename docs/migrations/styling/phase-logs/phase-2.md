# Phase 2 â€“ Shared Toolkit Foundation

**Date:** 2025-01-15

## Work Completed

- Added a `styles/mixins/` toolkit covering breakpoints, layout primitives, typography helpers, and state mixins with corresponding unit coverage.
- Captured the Tailwind preflight snapshot under `styles/generated/` with a scripted `pnpm preflight:snapshot` workflow and CI enforcement.
- Introduced `styles/base.scss` and `styles/global.scss`, replaced the Tailwind-only globals import with a Sass-first pipeline, and updated the app layout to use `data-theme` driven theming.
- Imported theme emitters for light/dark palettes, mapped legacy CSS variable aliases, and created a smoke test that compiles the global Sass to verify emitted tokens.
- Implemented a custom ESLint rule (`sass-boundary/no-external-import`) to keep `.module.scss` files colocated with their components and added unit tests for the rule.

## Validation

- `pnpm preflight:snapshot`
- `pnpm preflight:check`
- `pnpm vitest run tests/unit/styles/mixins.test.ts tests/unit/styles/base.test.ts tests/ui/global-styles.test.tsx`
- `pnpm vitest run tests/unit/eslint/sass-module-boundary.test.ts`
- `pnpm lint`

## Risks & Follow-ups

- Updated the token generator to use `sass:string.unquote`, eliminating the Dart Sass warnings that previously surfaced during targeted test runs.
- Full `pnpm test` still fails because of pre-existing single-player UI harness issues noted in Phase 1; we continue to rely on targeted suites for styling work.
- The new lint rule only checks static import paths; if we introduce dynamic resolution for styles we will need to broaden the rule.
