# Phase 1 – Token Sync Pipeline

**Date:** 2025-01-15

## Work Completed

- Added a structured Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.ts`) that centralises the design token catalogue (colors, spacing, radii, typography).
- Implemented `scripts/tokens/sync.ts` to emit generated Sass modules, a mirrored JSON export, and a checksum for drift detection.
- Generated initial artifacts under `styles/tokens/` and `.cache/tokens.hash`.
- Created light/dark theme emitters that delegate to the generated color mixins.
- Landed unit coverage for the generator (diff detection) and snapshot coverage for theme parity.
- Wired CLI tooling (`pnpm tokens:sync`, `pnpm tokens:watch`) and CI enforcement to keep artifacts in sync.
- Documented the workflow in `README.md` and `docs/ONBOARDING.md`.

## Validation

- `pnpm tokens:sync` (writes artifacts) ✅
- `pnpm tokens:sync -- --check` ✅
- `pnpm vitest run tests/unit/tokens/sync.test.ts` ✅
- Full `pnpm test` currently fails due to existing Single Player responsive UI tests requiring an app state mock; the new token-focused suites pass.

## Risks & Follow-ups

- Need to stabilise `pnpm test` by addressing the Single Player responsive spec harness before closing the next phase.
- Future phases must extend the generator to cover motion tokens once they are defined.
- Swapped the temporary custom TypeScript loader for `tsx` now that package installs are available, eliminating bespoke runtime glue.
