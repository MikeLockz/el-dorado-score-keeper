# IndexedDB Schema

## Overview

This document describes the IndexedDB schema used by the El Dorado Score Keeper application for local data persistence.

## Schema Versions

Version constants live in `lib/state/db.ts`:
- `SCHEMA_V1`
- `SCHEMA_V2`
- `SCHEMA_VERSION`

## Version 1

### Stores
- `events` - Stores application events with unique `eventId` index
- `state` - Stores application state snapshots
- `snapshots` - Stores state snapshots for different time periods

### Indexes
- `events` store has a unique `eventId` index for efficient lookups

## Version 2

### Changes from v1
- Added `games` store with non-unique `createdAt` index for listing archived games

### New Store
- `games` - Stores archived game records with:
  - Non-unique `createdAt` index for chronological listing
  - Game metadata for historical viewing

## Migration Process

### v1 â†’ v2 Migration
- Uses `onupgradeneeded` with `oldVersion` guards to avoid redundant index creation
- Only creates the `games` store and its index
- Preserves all existing data from v1 stores
- No data transformation required

### Migration Safety
- Migrations are designed to be idempotent
- Version checks prevent duplicate index creation
- Data preservation is guaranteed during upgrades

## Storage Architecture

### Event Store (`events`)
- Primary key: `eventId` (auto-generated UUID)
- Indexed by: `eventId` (unique)
- Purpose: Audit trail of all user actions and system events

### State Store (`state`)
- Primary key: store key
- Purpose: Current application state
- Used for: State restoration and real-time updates

### Snapshots Store (`snapshots`)
- Primary key: snapshot identifier
- Purpose: Historical state snapshots
- Used for: Undo/redo functionality and time-travel debugging

### Games Store (`games`)
- Primary key: `gameId`
- Indexed by: `createdAt` (non-unique)
- Purpose: Archived game records
- Used for: Game history and analytics

## Data Relationships

- Events reference game IDs for context
- Snapshots reference game IDs for game-specific history
- Games store contains final game state and metadata

## Browser Quota Management

The application monitors IndexedDB quota usage and provides user feedback when storage is limited.
