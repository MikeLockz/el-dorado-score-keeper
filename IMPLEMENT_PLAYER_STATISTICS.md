# Player Statistics Implementation Report

This document captures how the Player Statistics feature set was delivered against the requirements in `PLAYER_STATISTICS.md`, and it enumerates the outstanding guardrails that must land before we can close out the program.

## Overview

- Registered a dedicated statistics route and client view at `app/players/[playerId]/statistics/page.tsx` and `PlayerStatisticsView.tsx`, including roster selection, skeleton states, empty/error fallbacks, and cross-tab refresh handling.
- Hydrated statistics with `loadPlayerStatisticsSummary` in `lib/state/player-statistics.ts`, combining live Redux state with archived `GameRecord` bundles while normalizing canonical player ids, primary/secondary totals, round accuracy, hand insights, and advanced analytics.
- Historical data is cached and de-duplicated through `lib/state/player-statistics/cache.ts`; IndexedDB backfill tooling in `lib/state/player-statistics/backfill.ts` upgrades legacy bundles to `SUMMARY_METADATA_VERSION` before aggregation runs.
- Advanced analytics (trick efficiency, suit mastery, volatility, momentum) ship via `lib/state/player-statistics/advanced.ts` and render in `AdvancedInsightsPanel.tsx` alongside supporting UI cards (`PrimaryStatsCard`, `SecondaryStatsCard`, `RoundAccuracyChart`, `HandInsightsCard`).
- Test coverage spans selector helpers (`tests/unit/state/player-statistics/*.test.ts`), UI components (`tests/unit/components/player-statistics/*.test.tsx`), and the cross-tab subscription hook.
- Telemetry guardrails now emit `performance.mark` / `performance.measure` spans during historical aggregation and advanced calculators, cache hits/misses are logged through `captureBrowserMessage`, and cross-tab refreshes are debounced with queued/applied telemetry. UI strings remain inline English and must move into the i18n catalog.

## Phase 1 – Routing & Base View

- **Status**: Complete.
- **Implementation Highlights**: Added the `/players/[playerId]/statistics` route with dynamic metadata (`page.tsx`) and introduced `PlayerStatisticsView.tsx` to orchestrate loading, error, empty, and populated states. The view auto-selects the first roster entry, exposes a select control for player switching, and uses `useGamesSignalSubscription` to clear caches when IndexedDB archives change.
- **Validation**: `tests/unit/components/player-statistics/player-statistics-view.test.tsx` exercises loading, error, and empty scenarios. Manual smoke verifies navigation parity and skeleton renderings.
- **Gaps**: None. Cross-tab refreshes now debounce for 200 ms, clear caches once per burst, and emit queued/applied telemetry for observability.

## Phase 2 – Primary Metrics

- **Status**: Complete.
- **Implementation Highlights**: `loadPlayerStatisticsSummary` consolidates live and historical totals, while `computeHistoricalAggregates` tallies games played/won from normalized archives. Canonical-id enrichment is enforced via `normalizeHistoricalGame` and the `ensureHistoricalSummariesBackfilled` routine in `backfill.ts`, which can be gated through environment flags.
- **Validation**: `tests/unit/state/player-statistics/primary-metrics.test.ts` covers empty datasets, single-game histories, and tie scenarios. Backfill progress/warnings surface through `captureBrowserMessage`.
- **Gaps**: None functionally; telemetry follow-ups apply globally (cache logging still missing).

## Phase 3 – Secondary Metrics

- **Status**: Complete.
- **Implementation Highlights**: Secondary aggregates (average/highest/lowest scores, bid accuracy, median placement) compute inside `loadPlayerStatisticsSummary` and feed `SecondaryStatsCard.tsx`. Historical placements blend with live placements derived from the current Redux snapshot.
- **Validation**: `tests/unit/state/player-statistics/secondary-metrics.test.ts` and `tests/unit/components/player-statistics/secondary-stats-card.test.tsx` cover edge cases, loading, error, and populated states.
- **Gaps**: None beyond the telemetry and localization follow-ups shared across phases.

## Phase 4 – Round Accuracy

- **Status**: Complete.
- **Implementation Highlights**: Round-level aggregates replay bid/actual tallies, with visualization handled by `RoundAccuracyChart.tsx` using `@visx/heatmap`. Responsive layout listens to `ResizeObserver`, tooltips are keyboard-focusable, and overall accuracy summaries satisfy `PLAYER_STATISTICS.md` §4.2.
- **Validation**: `tests/unit/state/player-statistics/round-metrics.test.ts` checks per-round accumulation; `tests/unit/components/player-statistics/round-accuracy-chart.test.tsx` validates rendering, tooltip messaging, and empty states.
- **Gaps**: Labels and helper copy remain hard-coded English; migrate to the localization catalog.

## Phase 5 – Tertiary Metrics (Hand-Level)

- **Status**: Complete aside from localization copy.
- **Implementation Highlights**: `lib/state/player-statistics/hands.ts` replays `sp/trick/played` events, memoizes suit counts per game, and exposes canonical hand totals. `HandInsightsCard.tsx` renders total hands, top-suit callouts, and distribution bars with accessibility notes.
- **Validation**: `tests/unit/state/player-statistics/hand-insights.test.ts` exercises aggregation and caching; `tests/unit/components/player-statistics/hand-insights-card.test.tsx` covers loading, empty, and populated renderings.
- **Gaps**: All card text is inline English; add i18n keys before launch.

## Phase 6 – Advanced Metrics

- **Status**: Complete.
- **Implementation Highlights**: `lib/state/player-statistics/advanced.ts` derives trick efficiency, suit mastery, score volatility, and momentum samples across historical + live games. Results render in `AdvancedInsightsPanel.tsx`, including sparkline generation, accessible metric tiles, and `performance.mark` span coverage for the total routine plus each calculator.
- **Validation**: `tests/unit/state/player-statistics/advanced-metrics.test.ts` validates calculators; `tests/unit/components/player-statistics/advanced-insights-panel.test.tsx` ensures UI accuracy across empty/populated states.
- **Gaps**: None. Advanced metric calculators execute inside `performance` measurements, emitting spans for total execution and each calculator.

## Phase 7 – Launch & Hardening

- **Status**: In progress.
- **Shipped Artifacts**: Backfill tooling executes automatically (feature-flagged), warnings propagate via `captureBrowserMessage`, `resetPlayerStatisticsCache()` clears memoized selectors across secondary, hand, and advanced calculators, and telemetry now captures cache hits/misses, perf spans, and debounced cross-tab refresh events. Documentation/comments explain canonical-id expectations.
- **Outstanding Guardrails**:
  - Localize residual UI copy across statistics components and update translation docs.
- **Validation Needs**: After guardrails land, rerun `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, targeted integration smoke, and manual multi-tab scenarios; capture screenshots and telemetry dashboards for release sign-off.

## Testing & Tooling Summary

- Selector coverage: `tests/unit/state/player-statistics/advanced-metrics.test.ts`, `hand-insights.test.ts`, `primary-metrics.test.ts`, `round-metrics.test.ts`, `secondary-metrics.test.ts`.
- Component coverage: `tests/unit/components/player-statistics/*.test.tsx`, including cards, charts, the advanced panel, and the statistics view container.
- Hook coverage: `tests/unit/components/player-statistics/use-games-signal-subscription.test.tsx`.
- Manual QA has validated navigation, empty states, backfill enable/disable flows, and IndexedDB migrations; integration/UI automation is still a follow-up.

## Follow-Ups Before Launch

- Externalize all statistics UI strings into the i18n catalog and regenerate message bundles.
- Document the QA checklist (including multi-tab scenarios) and attach design screenshots once telemetry gaps close.
- Re-run the full validation matrix (lint, unit, integration smoke) after guardrail work, then capture metrics for observability dashboards.
