Add idempotency-focused tests for SP events if we tighten reducers to handle duplicates more defensively (e.g., guard duplicate sp/trick/played).

- shouldn't round 10 be first because it has 10 tricks? If it is the final round, why would it set the previous round to bidding? There won't be any more rounds after the final round.
- first make a plan on how to fix it so that rounds decrease in number by the number of tricks available in each round. First round is 10 and last round is 1.

Extend tests for out-of-order event robustness (e.g., clear before plays) in integration scenarios.

Remove vercel and v0 from readme and remove from github actions and remove any other reliance or reference to building on v0 or deploying via vercel

- i18n-Ready Names: Default name templates go through i18n to support non-English locales.

Add a toggle to the debug panel to enable/disable event logging to the console.

Add hyperdx for logging and monitoring. api key 9745ea4b-c080-4baf-a5a5-2a836b9c0e19

Do we have the data stored to expand each round to show all the hands played in that round? Each player's card and which won the trick? Do we have timestamps for each trick played?

Add a link at the bottom of Players > Players component to "See archived players" which when clicked shows a list of all archived players with an option to restore them. Archived players should not be shown in the main player list or in the add player dropdown when adding players to a roster. When in acrchive view there should be a link to "Back to players" to return to the main player list.
Archived players should be soft deleted. Add an "archived" boolean field to the player object in the data model. Use existing events and patterns and stores and models.
