# Remove UI Element

I need to completely remove the following UI element from the codebase and clean up all related code, tests, documentation, and dependencies.

## What I know:

- **Element to remove**: {{element}}
- **Identifying text**: {{text}}

## What I need you to do:

### Phase 1: Discovery

1. Search the entire codebase to find all references to this element
2. Identify the main component files where it's implemented
3. Find all test files that test this functionality
4. Locate any documentation that mentions it
5. Find related CSS, styles, or utility functions
6. Check for any routing, analytics, or configuration references

### Phase 2: Planning

Create a comprehensive list of all files that need to be modified or removed, grouped by:

- Main component files
- Test files
- Documentation files
- Configuration files
- Style files
- Utility/helper files

### Phase 3: Execution

1. Remove the main UI element from components
2. Remove or update related tests
3. Update documentation to remove references
4. Clean up any unused styles, utilities, or imports
5. Update routing or configuration if needed
6. Remove any analytics tracking

### Phase 4: Verification

1. Ensure the application builds successfully
2. Run all tests to make sure nothing is broken
3. Check for any remaining references in the codebase
4. Verify the UI looks correct without the removed element

## Important Notes:

- Be thorough in the discovery phase - don't miss any references
- Make changes incrementally to avoid breaking the application
- If you find dependencies on other components, handle those appropriately
- Keep backups mentally in case we need to restore something
- Explain what you're doing as you go so I can follow along

Please start with Phase 1 and show me what you find before proceeding.
