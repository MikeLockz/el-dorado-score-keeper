# Experiments

This folder contains self-contained prototypes that don’t require the main app build.

- `mobile-single-player-prototype/`: Mobile-first single-player layout prototype.
  - Open `index.html` directly in a browser to test.
  - No dependencies; pure HTML/CSS/JS.
  - Demonstrates: round/hand header, chips, card surface, sticky action bar, and a bottom sheet with snap points.

Notes

- The prototype uses placeholder data and lightweight interactions (card selection, finalize modal, trump toggles, score delta editing).
- It intentionally avoids app state or frameworks so it’s easy to iterate on layout and UX.
